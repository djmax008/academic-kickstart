The successful launch of electric vehicles (EVs) depends critically on the availability of convenient and economic charging facilities. The problem of admittance control and scheduling of large-scale charging of EVs by a service provider is considered. A Markov decision process model is introduced in which EVs arrive randomly at a charging facility with random demand and completion deadlines. The service provider faces random charging costs, convex non-completion penalties, and a peak power constraint that limits the maximum number of simultaneous activation of EV chargers.
