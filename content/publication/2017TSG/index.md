abstract = "Conventional control solutions of the inverter-interfaced microgrids are usually designed based on models with fully decoupled subsystems. The negligence of the strong coupling due to power lines impedance leads to large transient line currents, which might trigger false protection. Besides, the droop-based control methods unnecessarily introduce system frequency and voltage deviations. To overcome these issues, a novel distributed control scheme is proposed for the inverter-interfaced microgrids in this paper. The objective of the primary control is to regulate the bus voltages and frequency while suppressing the transient line currents. The objective of secondary control is to maintain fair load sharing. Both primary control and secondary control are distributed and subsystems or control agents only require measurements from local and neighboring subsystems. The detailed control problem formulation, control design and stability analysis are presented in the paper. The effectiveness of the proposed control solution is evaluated through extensive simulations based on both simplified and detailed models."
